# Tricks in Coq

Some tips, tricks, and features in Coq that are hard to discover.

If you have a trick you've found useful feel free to submit an issue or pull request!

## Ltac
* `pattern` tactic
* `lazymatch` for better error messages
* `deex` tactic
* `::=` to re-define Ltac
* `learn` approach - see [ClÃ©ment's thesis](http://pit-claudel.fr/clement/MSc/#org036d20e)
* `unshelve` tactical, especially useful with an eapply - good example use case is constructing an object by refinement where the obligations end up being your proofs with the values as evars, when you wanted to construct the values by proof
* `unfold "+"` works
* `destruct matches` tactic
* using `instantiate` to modify evar environment (thanks to Jonathan Leivent on coq-club)
* `eexists ?[x]` lets one name an existential variable to be able to refer to it later
* strong induction is in the standard library: `Require Import Arith.` and use `induction n as [n IHn] using lt_wf_ind.`
* induction on the length of a list: `Require Import Coq.Arith.Wf_nat.` and `induction xs as [xs IHxs] using (induction_ltof1 _ (@length _)); unfold ltof in IHxs.`
* `debug auto`, `debug eauto`, and `debug trivial` give traces, including failed invocations. `info_auto`, `info_eauto`, and `info_trivial` are less verbose ways to debug which only report what the resulting proof includes
* `constructor` and `econstructor` backtrack over the constructors over an inductive, which lets you do fun things exploring the constructors of an inductive type. See [Constructors.v](Constructors.v) for some demonstrations.
* There's a way to destruct and maintain an equality: `destruct_with_eqn x`.
  You can also do `destruct x eqn:H` to explicitly name the equality
  hypothesis. This is similar to `case_eq x; intros`; I'm not sure what the
  practical differences are.
* `rew H in t` notation to use `eq_rect` for a (safe) "type cast". Need to
  import `EqNotations` - see [RewNotation.v](RewNotation.v) for a working
  example.
* `intro`-patterns can be combined in a non-trivial way: `intros [=->%lemma]` -- see [IntroPatterns.v](IntroPatterns.v).
* `change` tactic supports patterns (`?var`): e.g. `repeat change (fun x => ?f x) with f` would eta-reduce all the functions (of arbitrary arity) in the goal.
* One way to implement a tactic that sleeps for n seconds is in [Sleep.v](Sleep.v).
* Some tactics take an "[occurrence clause](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html#occurrences-sets-and-occurrences-clauses)" to select where they apply. The common ones are `in *` and `in H` to apply everywhere and in a specific hypotheses, but there are actually a bunch of forms. The syntax is really silly so I'm just going to give examples and hope they help.
  - `in H1, H2` (just `H1` and `H2`)
  - `in H1, H2 |- *` (`H1`, `H2`, and the goal)
  - `in * |-` (just hypotheses)
  - `in |-` (nowhere)
  - `in |- *` (just the goal, same as leaving the whole thing off)
  - `in * |- *` (everywhere, same as `in *`)
  Why have all these forms, particularly the last two? They're useless, but if Coq ever supported first-class occurrence sets (that is, you could write tactics that takes occurrence sets and operate on them) they might be handy. Except `in |-`, which is probably useless and just an artifact of the grammar.
* You can use notations to shorten repetitive Ltac patterns (much like Haskell's [PatternSynonyms](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/PatternSynonyms#Motivatingexample)). Define a notation with holes (underscores) and use it in an Ltac match, eg `Notation anyplus := (_ + _).` and then
    ```
    match goal with
    | |- context[anyplus] => idtac
    end
    ```
  I would recommend using `Local Notation` so the notation isn't available outside the current file.

## Gallina
* tactics in terms, eg `ltac:(eauto)` can provide a proof argument
* maximally inserted implicit arguments are implicit even when for identifier alone (eg, `nil` is defined to include the implicit list element type)
* maximally inserted arguments can be defined differently for different numbers of arguments - undocumented but [`eq_refl` provides an example](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/trunk/theories/Init/Logic.v#L297-298)
* `r.(Field)` syntax: same as `Field r`, but convenient when `Field` is a projection function for the (record) type of `r`.
* `Function` vernacular provides a more advanced way to define recursive functions, which removes the restriction of having a structurally decreasing argument; you just need to specify a well-founded relation or a decreasing measure maps to a nat, then prove all necessary obligations to show this function can terminate. See [manual](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual004.html#sec78) and examples in `Function.v` for more details.

  Two alternatives are considerable as drop-in replacements for `Function`.
  * `Program Fixpoint` may be useful when defining a nested recursive function. See [manual](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/program.html#hevea_command290) and [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10292421/error-in-defining-ackermann-in-coq).
  * [CPDT's way](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/Cpdt.GeneralRec.html) of defining general recursive functions with `Fix` combinator.
* One can pattern-match on tuples under lambdas: `Definition fst {A B} : (A * B) -> A := fun '(x,_) => x.` (works since Coq 8.6).
* Records fields can be defined with `:>`, which make that field accessor a coercion. There are three ways to use this (since there are three types of coercion classes). See [Coercions.v](Coercions.v) for some concrete examples.
  - if the field is an ordinary type, the record can be used as that type (the field will implicitly be accessed)
  - if the field has a function type, the record can be called
  - if the field is a sort (eg, `Type`), then the record can be used as a type
* The type classes in RelationClasses are useful but can be repetitive to prove. [RelationInstances.v](RelationInstances.v) goes through a few ways of making these more convenient, and why you would want to do so (basically you can make `reflexivity`, `transitivity`, and `symmetry` more powerful).

## Other Coq commands
* `Search` vernacular variants; see [Search.v](Search.v) for examples.
* `Search s -Learnt` for a search of local hypotheses excluding Learnt
* `Locate` can search for notation, including partial searches.
* `Optimize Heap` (undocumented) runs GC (specifically [`Gc.compact`](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Gc.html))
* `Optimize Proof` (undocumented) runs several simplifications on the current proof term (see [`Proofview.compact`](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/9a4ca53a3a021cb16de7706ec79a26e49f54de49/engine/proofview.ml#L40))
* `Generalizable Variable A` enables implicit generalization; `Definition id `(x:A) := x` will implicitly add a parameter `A` before `x`. `Generalizable All Variables` enables implicit generalization for any identifier. Note that this surprisingly allows generalization without a backtick in Instances; see [InstanceGeneralization.v](InstanceGeneralization.v). [Issue #6030](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6030) generously requests this behavior be documented, but it should probably require enabling some option.

## Using Coq
* You can pass `-noinit` to `coqc` or `coqtop` to avoid loading the standard library. Ltac is provided as a plugin loaded by the standard library; to load it you need `Declare ML Module "ltac_plugin".` (see [NoInit.v](NoInit.v)).
